# HumaniTree Backend: From Crypto to Real Trees üå≥

## üéØ **Why We Built This System**

HumaniTree transforms digital tokens into real environmental impact. But there's a challenge: **how do you seamlessly convert someone's WLD tokens into actual tree donations while ensuring every step is transparent and verifiable?**

Our backend solves this by creating a **complete simulation environment** that demonstrates the entire user journey from crypto wallet to planted trees - without requiring users to spend real money or wait for actual blockchain transactions during demos.

## üß† **The Big Picture: What We're Solving**

### **The User Journey We Enable:**
1. **User has WLD tokens** (Worldcoin's cryptocurrency)
2. **User wants to plant trees** (environmental impact)
3. **System swaps WLD ‚Üí USDC** (stable currency NGOs accept)
4. **System donates USDC to verified NGO** (Rainforest Foundation US)
5. **User gets impact receipt** (trees planted, CO2 offset, blockchain proof)

### **The Challenge:**
- Real blockchain transactions are slow and expensive for demos
- Users don't want to spend real money just to see how it works
- Investors and judges need to see the complete flow instantly
- We need to prove the economics work at scale

### **Our Solution:**
Build a **realistic simulation system** that shows exactly how the real system would work, with accurate pricing, real NGO partnerships, and scientifically correct environmental impact calculations.
